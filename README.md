Playful attempt at creating a website from scratch

There are 6 buttons to inspect on the home page. The only tab with considerable content is the "Cat" button.
I wrote the html by hand. That is a very labor intensive process. I am assuming there are better ways to approach web design.
However, I wanted to learn about the fundamental functionality of html code so I thought this was a good exercise.
